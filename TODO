Okay, Cyrillic doesn't work, probably other symbol fonts don't work.
We probably want to drop these then since they don't function correctly.

Or we consider a completely different approach.

- Write math resolution peeking PostScript
- Add Cyrillic, Greek (other fonts?) to sample
- Write results of tests including screenshots
- Test math cut/paste vs Type 1
- Test accents vs Type 1

Tools to use to test:

   ps2pdf (based on ghostview)
   pstopdf (Apple OSX)
   pdftopng (Glyph and Cog/xpdf) -- warns if font bounding box is "wrong"
   gs with png output driver

Dvips integration:

Read static encoding vectors and hash them into deduplication array
For every read static encoding vector, deduplicate
Free encoding vectors only in deduplication
Deduplication should include entry indicating downloaded name
Fonts should add entry for bitmap encoding vector

Bitmap font download:

Get encoding:
   If we have it, return it
   Scan list of font/encoding pairs; if we find a match, return it
   Try to load from encoding file; if good, add to list and return it
   Try to fall back to static bitmap fonts (and warn); if good, add to list
   Warn again and fall back to a static ASCII/standard encoding

We will ignore PostScript memory consumption for the moment, as this makes
a small delta.
